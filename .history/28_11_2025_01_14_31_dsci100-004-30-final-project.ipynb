    "A research group in Computer Science at UBC has set up a MineCraft server to tackle the problem of predicting usage of a video game research server. By using the information in the given datasets - players.csv and sessions.csv - the following question can be answered: What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we aim to answer the question: Can played hours and age predict the value of subscription in players? generated by specifying the broad question above. Our dataset of choice is the players.csv table; this database contains information related to connecting player characteristics and subscriptions together which is required to answer our question. We have chosen three specific variables to use to reach a conclusion: played_hours, age, and subscribe. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. played_hours: gaming hours of each individual\n",
    "2. age: age of individual players in years\n",
    "3. subscribe: whether or not the individual is subscribed to a game related newspaper\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of our project is to propose a model that concludes whether or not the number of hours played on this server as well as the age of the individual playing can be used to determine if a player will subscribe to the newsletter. We chose to avoid predictors in the dataset that were not relevant to the exact characteristics we wanted to experiment with to evaluate if it contributed to the likelihood of subscribing or not. For instance, the dataset included the following in addition to the variables listed above: \n",
    "\n",
    "- hashed email\n",
    "- player name\n",
    "- player experience\n",
    "- player gender\n",
    "\n",
    "These were all excluded in our observations. Thus we believe that the played hours, age, and subscription values are the best fit to conclude if a player is subscribed or not. "
